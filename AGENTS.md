# Project Guidance for AI Agents

## Purpose
- This is a Vite + React app for a number comparison / concentration game.
- Keep changes minimal and aligned with the existing look and feel.

## Project Structure
- Source code: `src/`
- Main UI: `src/App.jsx`
- Result page UI and share image: `src/components/Results.jsx`
- Static assets: `public/` and `src/assets/`

## Conventions
- Use ASCII in new text where possible.
- Prefer small, focused edits.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless requested.
- Match existing inline style usage in components.

## Share Image Notes
- Share image is rendered in `src/components/Results.jsx`.
- Canvas size targets 16:9; keep text layout balanced.
